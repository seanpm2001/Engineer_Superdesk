# Engineer_Superdesk
An open source recreation of the suite of AutoDesk modeling software. I used AutoDesk in my engineering class in High School, but was disappointed to find that there were no free or free and open source alternates to it.

as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of June 23rd 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

## About

See above. This project is an open source recreation and alternative of the suite of AutoDesk, as no open source alternative exists.

***

### Placeholder icon

I am currently using an image of the [Engineer](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Engineer) from [Team Fortress 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2) as a placeholder logo for this project, as I don't have any other images to use at the moment. It will be a placeholder for now, but I will get my own image in the future. I am still undecided on how it will be designed, so the first contest will be what the logo is, then the second contest will be what the logo will be.

***

## Builds

There currently is only 1 build of this project, and it is far from complete. The project needs to be converted from HTML5 to another language.

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

## History

I started this project in 2019 during High School. I was taking an engineering class, and we had to use this software called AutoDesk Inventor. I liked it, except for 1 huge problem: it was proprietary software, and it costs tons of money to use (in between the amount for paying for Microsoft Office and paying for Adobe CC) I also couldn't find any good open-source alternatives to it, so I started my own.

This project is still an early work in progress. It will first attempt to emulate the experience of AutoDesk Inventor, then I will work on emulating the experience of other AutoDesk engineering software projects.

In June 2020, during my beginning times on GitHub, I began publishing projects that I had as Private Free and Open Source software for quite some time. This project was included in the uploads on June 8th 2020.

In June 2021, during my GitHub organization period, I made an organization for this project. I later learned how to use GitHub pages, and created its own GitHub page, and development partially resumed.

No other history at the moment.
