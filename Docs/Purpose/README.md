# The purpose of Engineer Superdesk

## Background

In my 12th grade year of high school, I used a software called `AutoDesk Inventor` and really liked it. I had some major problems with it however, mainly the fact that it doesn't support Linux, that it was proprietary, and costs money through a subscription.

I wanted to build a similar software that meets my needs, one that works as open source software, with no subscriptions, and no platform limitations.

## Additional features

After abandoning the project for a while, I came back in 2022 with a revolutionary new feature: architecture libraries.
