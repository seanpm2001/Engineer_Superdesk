The current logo in use is only a placeholder. It is not the official logo, and I don't intend it to be (not just because of copyright, but because I just don't feel it will fit in a serious setting)

I am looking for a new logo, but I don't need it urgently.

#### Submissions

I hope to get a Skeuomorphic logo as a replacement. I will not accept flat/material design logos for the official project. The image also cannot be in WebP, GIF, or TIFF formats, if it is in one of these formats, it needs to be exported to PNG, JPG/JPEG/JFIF/JIF/etc., or SVG. If it is in GIF format, it shouldn't be exported, as GIF files are limited to 256 colors, and it would turn out ugly. I hope I am not asking for too much.

I am currently unsure what the icon should resemble.
